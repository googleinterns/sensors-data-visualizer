# Sensors Data Visualizer

Debugging sensors using raw sensor data is not intuitive. Sensor data represents physical movements and so reading raw data does not allow a developer to understand where sensor issues may be present, especially when they are trying to compare multiple sensors. This project aims to provide a visual representation of sensor data so that a user can more easily diagnose issues. This visualization tool will allow users to input sensor data from multiple sources and will be easily extendible to new sources.  The tool will then parse the input data and plot the data on an easily readable graph, with additional features that allow for more insights into the data.
